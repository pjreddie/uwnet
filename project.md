# Example Project

Write a 3-4 sentence abstract. It should introduce the problem and your approach. You may also want some numbers like 35 mAP and 78% accuracy. You can use this example README for your project, you can use a different ordering for your website, or you can make a totally different website altogether!

VIDEO GOES HERE (probably): Record a 2-3 minute long video presenting your work. One option - take all your figures/example images/charts that you made for your website and put them in a slide deck, then record the video over zoom or some other recording platform (screen record using Quicktime on Mac OS works well). The video doesn't have to be particularly well produced or anything.

## Introduction

In this section the problem you are working on. Maybe talk about why you thought it was interesting. Or why you think it needs to get solved.

You may also want to say a little bit here about what you did. Not too much though. Don't give the whole game away.

## Related Work

Other people are out there doing things. What did they do? Was it good? Was it bad? Talk about it here.

## Approach

How did you decide to solve the problem? What network architecture did you use? What data? Lots of details here about all the things you did. This section describes almost your whole project.

Figures are good here. Maybe you present your network architecture or show some example data points?

## Results

How did you evaluate your approach? How well did you do? What are you comparing to? Maybe you want ablation studies or comparisons of different methods.

You may want some qualitative results and quantitative results. Example images/text/whatever are good. Charts are also good. Maybe loss curves or AUC charts. Whatever makes sense for your evaluation.

## Discussion

You can talk about your results and the stuff you've learned here if you want. Or discuss other things. Really whatever you want, it's your project.
